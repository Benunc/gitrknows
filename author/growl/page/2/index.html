<p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2007-11-20T16:18:32-05:00">November 20, 2007</time> By <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/author/growl/" class="entry-author-link" rel="author" itemprop="url"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Growl</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/2007/11/20/saying-goodbye-to-the-battlegrounds-and-leveling-a-pvp-alt/#comments">7 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/wownews/remember.jpg" class="left">So &#8211; one of my ALT-er-ego&#8217;s is a Tauren Shaman.  He started life as a 10-19 battlegrounds twink on Thorium Brotherhood (US) way, way back when that server first launched.  Back then, his name was &#8220;Remember&#8221; and he was my first attempt at leveling &#8211; or PvPing with a shaman.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of time went by and for much of it, Remember was played little.  I managed to get him up to &#8220;Grunt&#8221; rank in the old PvP ranking system before it was shelved (the equivalent of a  Corporal for you Alliance folk) and  he had decent gear for a level 19 battleground brat.  I enjoyed PvPing with Remember &#8211; but was burnt out from getting my main into the officer ranks.  As a result, Remember spent more time cooling his heels than tossing out heals.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Remember became one of my support alts &#8211; a well geared bank that could gather herbs and brew speed potions for my other characters.  In time I finally decided that my other toons had more to benefit from Remember&#8217;s alchemy skill growing than I did by having (yet another) semi-twinked level 19 in my stable.  So &#8211; with a resigned sigh,  Remember headed back out to the barrens &#8211; hit level 20 in about an hour &#8211; and promptly got shelved for several months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/wownews/bgwin.jpg"></p>
<p>Now &#8211; over a year later &#8211; enter a new server &#8211; and a forced name change.</p>
<p>Remember is now Skychaser on Moon Guard.  I rerolled over there a while back and hooked up with a guild full of alting battlegrounds geeks like myself.  Having a good time with this new crew, I decided to bring my old potion maker over from Thorium Brotherhood in order to shill pots for my current toons and guildies alike.  Eventually &#8211; out of a desire to learn more about the Shaman class and to try something new, I leveled Skychaser/Remember to 29 and camped battlegrounds again until I snagged my usual belt, boots and baubles from Arathi Basin and Warsong Gulch.  I enjoyed pvping with the shaman at 29 &#8211; but the road had been hard.  Worse, in PvE, I always felt that soloing with the big white Tauren had proven tedious and awkward.   Skychaser ended up dead a lot and I spent a lot of time reading forums and trying to understand why this once formidable class was so hard for me to wrap my head around.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/wownews/scav.jpg" class="centered"></p>
<p>Finding few answers other than the angst over on the official Shaman forums about how massively the class had been nerfed &#8211; I finally turned to instances and grouping.  Now &#8211; by nature &#8211; I&#8217;m a solo player.  I love instances and love raiding &#8211; but rarely have time or patience to endure the endless waiting for pug groups to form, or the disastrous outcomes that most pugs seem to enable.  The new guild had good people in it though and I managed to hook Sky&#8217; up to various low level runs through several instances.  What I learned while doing this, was that while I felt like four-thumbed failure in solo-PvE and PvP, I felt like a small gawd in group play.</p>
<p>Running Skychaser through instances was a revelation in rediscovering the strength of hybrid classes in group play.  He could tank, he could dps, he could heal and cleanse.  Groups that were having problems with an instance immediately seem to find a greater deal of success with the shaman in tow.  His totems provided low cost healing and mana &#8211; gave supportive buffs or purged negative spell effects.  When things went pear-shaped his ability to rez or (better yet) self-rez after a wipe extended his value in groups from &#8220;spare war-stomp with h33ls&#8221; to &#8220;invaluable multi-function tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intrigued with the class &#8211; I broke out of the 20-29 bracket and discovered Windfury.  While still suffering from a past nerf, quintessential Shaman melee trait was the fuel I needed to propel Skychaser through the long and still somewhat awkward climb through the 30&#8217;s.  Sky&#8217; was still having to work for his levels &#8211; but the additional melee prowess was noticeable and appreciated.  Somewhere after level 35 though &#8211; and finally being able to advance his capped alchemy skill &#8211; Sky&#8217; stalled and his progress lagged.  Quests in the 30&#8217;s seemed to be harder to find &#8211; the task of leveling easier &#8211; but still arduous for the enhancement Shammy.  I started to wonder if he was doomed to be a cast-off potion maker forever.</p>
<p>Then 2.3 hit.</p>
<p>With higher experience for kills and quests as well as easier leveling, post 2.3 Azeroth is likely to become the saving grace of stalled alts everywhere.  In an afternoon of questing in STV, Skychaser saw level 36 come and go in a blink.  Later in the same week, questing in Desolace and a run through Scarlet Monestary&#8217;s Library and Armory wings brought 37 and 38 in rapid succession.  A few odd clean up quests and a daily battleground quest or two and suddenly 39 was attained.  Shocked with how fast the last 4 levels had come I took time at 39 to dive back into Arathi Basin.  Again &#8211; Skychaser proved a revelation in the battlegrounds.  A well geared 39 &#8211; the vigor and force of his windfury crits &#8211; the speed of his improved ghost wolf &#8211; and the versatility of his heals, totems, and purge ability put Sky at the top of charts in game after game.  In one long evening of back to back play &#8211; he collected  over 50 tokens and became the focus fire target of every alliance group that he crossed paths with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/wownews/skychaserah.jpg" class="centered"></p>
<p>Last night, with my 30-39 battlegrounds aspirations complete, I left Arathi Basin and headed off to Duskwallow Marsh.  Starting two bars into 39 &#8211; I muddled my way around from quest giver to quest giver in the refreshed zone.  I took my time to discover these new adventures and to farm herbs.  Before I realized it,  I had cleared out the first half of my quests in the zone and rather unexpectedy watched Skychaser disappear in a flourish of golden light as  he dinged 40.</p>
<p>Holy cats that was fast.</p>
<p>A quick trip back to Thunderbluff allowed Sky&#8217; to train.  Packing stormstrike now &#8211; and an amazing chain-heal ability, the one time potions alt is now quickly becoming a favored main.  I still have a lot of work to do with this toon, after all, there is a mount to buy, rep to gain and 30 more levels to discover.  But I&#8217;m excited about leveling him, confident I can get him to outlands, and eager to see the world through his eyes while in the game.</p>
<p>I can safely that the leveling changes of 2.3 are going to provide a new lease on life for stalled alts.  For all the raiding guilds trying to replace lost healers and tanks by slowly leveling alts on the side &#8211; they now have hope of actually bringing some of these toons into play in reasonable time.  It&#8217;s going to be easier to move from bracket to bracket in the PvP arena &#8211; perhaps creating a bit more life in some of the less played battlegrounds.  All in all &#8211; I have to rate the leveling change in 2.3 as my mvp &#8211; (most valuable patch.)  Time for many gamers is sparse and the ability to fill what hours we *do* have with achievable and entertaining goals is by far the best bang for the buck I can hope for.</p>

<p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2007-11-19T16:13:17-05:00">November 19, 2007</time> By <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/author/growl/" class="entry-author-link" rel="author" itemprop="url"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Growl</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/2007/11/19/exalted-with-arathi-basin-only-419-games-to-go/#comments">11 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>So on Monday, Growl likes to troll the official forums and see what the BLUES have to say about things.  One little bit of rantage that I came across had to do with the Arathi Basin battleground and just *how* long it would  take to reach exalted.</p>
<p>The post started out with a fairly distraught fellow that had come to the conclusion that to reach exalted status with AB he needed to play something like 23,800 games &#8211; which worked out (assuming around 30 minutes a game) to the disproportionately large time hack of 58 days of played time in Arathi Basin alone.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/wownews/abmap.jpg" class="left"> Needless to say my jaw dropped.  58 days of /played &#8211; in AB?  That&#8230;that&#8217;s just insane&#8230;it&#8217;s worse than insane &#8211; it&#8217;s criminal!  Who could *stand* to play that much Arathi Basin?  Great Spirit-In-The-Sky think of the children!!!</p>
<p>Before I could work myself up into a truly indignant rage, I remembered that some good friends had hit exalted back under the old PvP system.  They seemed okay.  No twitches or night terrors about losing the Lumber Mill or waking up screaming that the Farm is getting ninja&#8217;d.  A couple even had families.  How could this number be right?</p>
<p>Intrigued, I combed through a few more pages of the post until I caught on to a friendly fellow that paid closer attention to grade-school math.</p>
<p>The *real* break down to hitting exalted in AB looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neutral to Friendly &#8212; 30 Games</li>
<li>Friendly to Honored &#8212; 60 Games</li>
<li>Honored to Revered &#8212; 120 Games</li>
<li>Revered to Exalted &#8212; 210 games</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a grand total of 420 games.  Now the numbers assume 100 rep points per turn-in and don&#8217;t include fun things <img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/wownews/abmarks.jpg" class="left">like AB Honor Weekends or bonus rep earned from quests so the actual number is likely to ball park a bit lower.  That said, it&#8217;s still an accomplishment.</p>
<p>With this in mind, has the addition of the new &#8220;Conquerer&#8221; title lead any of you to try and hit exalted with all three of the original battlegrounds? Have you already done it?  Send us a screenshot of your toon and let us know what the grind was like!</p>

<p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time" itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2007-11-15T18:51:18-05:00">November 15, 2007</time> By <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/author/growl/" class="entry-author-link" rel="author" itemprop="url"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Growl</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/2007/11/15/new-warden-in-town/#comments">4 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>For those of you that missed it &#8211; a good while back, Blizzard made the news in a hard way when consumers learned that the gaming company had included a sneaky bit of anti-cheating software into the World of Warcraft client.  The software is called &#8220;Warden&#8221; and has been around for some time busting punks and catching cheaters in Blizzard&#8217;s Battlenet service.  One of the less known features of patch 2.3 is a newer and much stronger version of the Warden.  It is believed that this new version is significantly more powerful in its pursuit of those trying to exploit the games Terms of Service.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/warden/purplz.jpg" class="left">At first blush, this seems pretty reasonable.  No one likes competing against botters and gold-pharmers for in game resources .  Nor do they like the impact that these actions can have on server economies.  For that matter it&#8217;s safe to say that the average gamer is even less thrilled about keyloggers and trojans, both of which can be used to hijack an account leaving the toons inside naked and penniless.  If the Warden is there to protect us from the predations of tools like these &#8211; then more power to it right?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.  According to the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, Warden is technically spyware&#8230;spyware that runs on our home computer and dutifully reports our activities back to the Blizzard mothership.  Creepy but not necessarily <em>evil</em>?  I mean after all, Blizzard is just trying to keep the playing field level for the actual gamerz while providing no safe haven for professional cheaters, hackers, and gold/level pharmers.  According to folks at Blizzard &#8211; that&#8217;s exactly the letter and spirit of their intent.</p>
<p>Despite this, there are an increasing number of folks who are up in arms about the Warden and markedly unhappy that the tool has taken up residence on their hard-drives.  They claim that not only is the Warden able to comb through virtually all parts of your computer &#8211; but that its findings are often arbitrary and have been the cause of unjust bannings and account closures.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s hard to measure the veracity of these claims, it is clear that the Warden has a great deal of power.   Greg Hoglund, a security expert and author has spent a fair amount of time looking at what Warden does while it runs in the background of our game.  According to <a href="http://www.rootkit.com/blog.php?newsid=358" title="Greg Hoglund's BLOG">Hoglund&#8217;s Blog</a>, the Warden runs about every 15 seconds while we play and does a number of things including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reads information from the World of Warcraft Application and all of the dynamically linked code libraries that make it up</li>
<li>Grabs the &#8220;window text&#8221; from the titlebar of every open application window&#8230;including applications that have nothing to do with WoW</li>
<li>Through these open applications Warden was able to sniff through the e-mail addresses of contacts in chat clients, pull the URL&#8217;s of open websites and the names of all of his running applications &#8211; even the ones in his toolbar</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="edgeatext">According to Hoglund, the application then compares this information to built in &#8220;libraries&#8221; of &#8220;bannable data.&#8221;  Simply put &#8211; if something you&#8217;re running is actively against the terms of service (such as a botting application like WoW-Glide) then that fact is zipped off to Blizzard who can then immediately flag your account for investigation or closure.  This is a careful difference.  No personal information of yours is technically passed to Blizzard, instead, they simply look at what&#8217;s going on in your system and then compare it against a list of things they think are suspect.  If Warden finds a match &#8211; he calls home and tells mom about it.  This allows Warden to be quite invasive in its exploration of our running processes &#8211; without technically telling anyone at Blizzard how much money is in our Quicken Checking Account.</span></p>
<p><span class="edgeatext">&#8220;So what?&#8221; one might say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t bot, I don&#8217;t buy gold, and no one else has access to my account &#8211; so I have nothing to worry about.&#8221;  In a sense, this is true, it&#8217;s easy to not fear a tool like the Warden when you game with the righteous.  But what happens if you inadvertently surfed to a gold selling website and didn&#8217;t think to close the window before launching WoW?  When Warden runs does it know the difference between someone buying gold and someone who&#8217;s just browsing?  Does Blizzard care?  The problem is that no one outside of Blizzard knows what the rules are when it comes to account banning or closure and thus it&#8217;s truly impossible to know how a certain action might be looked at.</span></p>
<p>To the truly paranoid this is on par with allowing police the ability to search your home at any time &#8211; with no search warrant &#8211; and then being subject to prosecution for offenses that only they know exist.   Regardless of how you might feel about gold pharming or botting &#8211; there is a certain atavistic fear involved with someone that can invade your privacy at any time and report on your actions.  Blizzard claims to only want to protect their game and their business (as well as your in game experience) from the predations of those that would exploit it.  This is understandable &#8211; reasonable even.  But every WoW player signs away a small (or large depending upon how you look at it) bit of their privacy when they accept the Terms of Service for the game, without really understanding what&#8217;s living on their hard-drive.</p>
<p>As of 2.3 &#8211; there is a new wrinkle.  Not only do we have the toughest, meanest, most ruthless version of the Warden resident on our computers, but he now speaks a language that only Blizzard can understand.  That&#8217;s right &#8211; the output from the new Warden is now completely encrypted.  In the past, a number of bloggers and gamers supported Blizzard&#8217;s use of Warden because the results of the application rumbling around their hard-drive could be monitored by other applications or tracked by a good firewall.  This is no longer the case.  While the Warden may be as benign as ever to the honest WoW player, the fact remains that what he does on our systems is now completely obfuscated from even the most technical.  While most of us will continue to play World of Warcraft &#8211; the fact remains that the application now resident in the guts of our game is one that monitors our actions and speaks in tongues.  The results of these incomprehensible conversations have great power over our ability to play the game.  Yet none of us know the rules it judges our worthiness by &#8211; or when it might find us wanting.</p>
<p>This latest action by Blizzard takes some of the luster off of what I believe to be an exemplary patch to the game. Now I don&#8217;t personally believe that Blizzard is mining my personal information or communicating my bank balance and shopping preferences to Blizzard.  But the fact remains that I don&#8217;t appreciate that the functions of the tool are no longer transparent.  Only time will tell how effective the new watch-dog program will be.  Can it bring an end to the corruption of WoW economies by gold sales?  Can it protect players from those that would compromise their accounts and steal the fruit of their in-game labors (or worse &#8211; their credit card numbers and account passwords?)  Will it be a fair arbiter of justice? Or will we begin to see innocent people get their accounts banned because they surfed the wrong web-page, communicated with the wrong people in IM or received SPAM e-mail from known gold sellers?</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t have a single tin-foil hat in my closet, I can&#8217;t help but feel a bit creeped out about all I&#8217;ve learned.  I know from now on, when I play &#8211; I&#8217;ll close <em>everything </em>but the game itself.  This in itself is a bit of a drag on my in game experience since I&#8217;m used to having FireFox open (with about a million tabs) and my mail and chat clients all open.  As a mac user it&#8217;s easy enough to run WoW in a window and keep up with the rest of my online life at the same time.  But like having to maintain some kind of half understood systema or to maintain command information security, I&#8217;m now feeling pressured to mitigate how I enjoy the game &#8211; because I just don&#8217;t know what it might say about me while I play.</p>

<p>Brian Kopp, author of the extremely successful Alliance 1-70 leveling guides has just finished updating his guide for WoW 2.3!  Kopp&#8217;s guide is touted as one of the fastest ways to level an Alliance character and with the increased quest experience and decreased leveling requirements that went live with 2.3, things have only gotten better.</p>
<p>According to Kopp &#8211; the changes in 2.3 now allow players to easily level from 1-60 with absolutely ZERO grinding!</p>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Levels 20-60 reworked for patch 2.3 so that all the improved experience changes were documented. This now allows the guide to be 100% questing 1-60 and no grinding</li>
<li>Enlarged the font and changed it to a cleaner style</li>
<li>Removed border from edge of pages while changing the margins slightly</li>
<li>Added page numbers to all pages</li>
<li>Separated the guide into 3 sections. One section for all the starting races up to 20, one section for 20-60 and one section for 60-70</li>
</ul>
<p>Kopp is also offering level 1-20 of this guide for free!  If you&#8217;ve ever been curious about how these guides look, this is an excellent chance to see it in action and try it for yourself.  Gitr Knows WoW is an affiliate for Brian&#8217;s leveling guide &#8211; so we&#8217;re a bit biased on its quality.  Don&#8217;t take our word &#8211; try it out yourself.

<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/belfmask/bloodelfmask.jpg" class="left" alt="Blood Elf Bandit Mask" height="407" width="170">These silly things are pretty awesome looking.  They are non-binding bits of vanity gear that drop off of rarely found, stealthed blood elf bandits on Azuremyst Isle.  Unlike the plain red defias bandit masks that drop off of brotherhood rogues in Westfall, the Blood Elf Bandit Mask is not class specific, anyone can wear one!  Alliance players that are patient enough to hunt down these stealthed level 7 blood elf bandits on Azuremyst Isle have a fairly decent chance of getting one.  For those of you that don&#8217;t know, Azuremyst Isle and the Exodar are only a quick boat ride from Auberdine.  Horde players are going to have a tougher time of it.  High level Horde rogues and druids can easily stealth their way onto the boat.  So if you have a higher level horde main (preferably with an epic mount)  you can show up on Azuremyst unscathed and spend your next hour or more tearing around the island hunting these guys.</p>
<p>For lower level Horde characters intent on acquiring a mask &#8211; be prepared for either a looong ghost run from the Barrens or Ashenvale &#8211; or &#8211; you can make  your way to Auberdine and let  yourself get killed near (or on) the Azuremyst Boat.  You&#8217;ll likely get murdered again once you get off the boat &#8211; so make sure to be doing this little jaunt &#8216;sans-gear&#8217; or you&#8217;ll have a repair bill to go along with what could be hours of fruitless searching.</p>
<p>For those of you that aren&#8217;t familiar with Auberdine or which boat goes where.  Simply find the inn and check out the pier.  There are two boats that have historically docked here.  About halfway out the pier is a &#8216;t&#8217; junction &#8211; where the boats to Menethil Harbor and Ruth&#8217;theran Village have always docked. The newest boat arrives at the far end of the pier (there are signs &#8211; try to look for them if you&#8217;re running from the Auberdine guards!)</p>
<p><strong>How to Find Them</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of known spawn points that ring the island.  With a high level main and an epic mount, you can cover a lot of ground quickly.  Everyone else &#8211; best bet is to pick a region and camp the spawn points.  Re-pop time on these guys is somewhere between 2 and 5 minutes &#8211; with the next bandit appearing at a new location after the last is killed.</p>
<p><strong>Click on the map to see known spawn points and a suggested route to take to find these guys</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rofkahr.com/images/WOW/azurelarge.jpg" rel="lightbox[815]"><img decoding="async" src="http://www.rofkahr.com/images/WOW/azuresmall.jpg" alt="Azuremyst Isle" height="231" width="346"></a></p>
<p>Hordies that aren&#8217;t uber leveled are suggested to take an alternate routes anytime the path crosses too close to the Exodar 🙂</p>
<p>A simple macro can also help snuffle these guys out.  Just create a new macro and type the following:</p>
<p><code>/target Blood Elf</code></p>
<p>Put that on an action bar somewhere and just spam the crap out of it as you race around Azuremyst Isle.  If you manage to find one this way &#8211; stop immediately and start searching in a tight circular pattern until you either see his stealthed figure &#8211; or he ambushes you.  Either works.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8211; I hope this has been entertaining and helpful.  For those of you that are hard to teach or resistant to helpful tips &#8211; here are a few that I can&#8217;t stress enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. These guys are on Azuremyst Isle &#8211; not Bloodmyst Isle<br>
2. A mask won&#8217;t drop with every kill<br>
3  Others are hunting these guys at the same time you are.<br>
4. This might take minutes&#8230;it might take hours.</p>
<p>I killed elves on Bloodmyst Isle for over an hour one night thinking that the masks randomly dropped off the packs of blood elves camped behind Blood Watch.  I gained a level in that time and gathered stacks of cloth &#8211; but no mask.  A little google searching and some patience would have saved me that trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve Got One..Now What?</strong></p>
<p>Wear it dummy!  Give it to a friend &#8211; give it to a favorite 10-19 battleground twink!  Or do like a lot of other folks are doing and sell that bad dog.  Prices are variable these days so selling them is still a bit of a hit and miss thing. <a href="http://www.wowecon.com/">WoW Econ</a> is showing historical prices on the Alliance side to be running around a 10G average over the month of November, 2007 &#8211; though your server economy will dictate.  Back in the early days of the Burning Crusade, these cheese-cloth wonders would fetch as much as 25-50G.  The fervor has died down somewhat, but you can still make a tidy sum selling to folks willing to pay well for RP clothes or who simply want a unique look on their latest alt.</p>
<p><strong> Matching Robe? </strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/belfmask/robe.jpg" class="right">According to some folks &#8211; there is another drop available on Azuremyst that makes a great compliment to the mask.  <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=31264">The Silvermoon Robe Family</a> are a fairly nice couple of cloth robes that would make any level ALT level 13-20 feel like the best dressed toon in Azeroth.  The robe usually drops off of <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html?wmob=22060&amp;locale=enUS;source=live">Fenissa the Assassin</a> (rare mob) who can be found around the Vector Coil or Cryo Core (she stays stealthed, but you can usually find her fairly easily.)</p>
<p><strong> Growl&#8217;s Experience Hunting The Mask</strong></p>
<p>Growl has managed to nab 4 of these things.  I haven&#8217;t managed to find one dropping in any one location more than I have the other &#8211; so I can&#8217;t recommend choice hunting spots.  The best bet is to keep an eye out around the marked spawn locations and hope you get lucky.  The drop rate isn&#8217;t spectacular &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t bad either.  The real problem is finding the bloody belf where ever he happens to be on the map.  I&#8217;ve circumnavigated Azuremyst for an hour straight and not seen the blighter before.  Other times &#8211; I&#8217;ve had him start stabbing me in the kidneys when I least expected it.  As usual with most rare drops and rare spawn in the game &#8211; your mileage may vary &#8211; and vary wildly.</p>
<p>Good Luck and Happy Hunting!</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.wowblues.com/us/season-3-delay-2856015159.html" title="Season 3 Delayed">Drysc</a>, the start of Arena Season 3 will be delayed exactly one week.  Now set to roll out on November 27th, the start of season three was moved due to concerns that unforeseen problems might manifest over the Thanksgiving Holiday.  The delay is expected to allow Blizzard developers a better opportunity to address any issues with the start of the new season.</p>
