<p>I&#8217;m taking a hiatus to finish college (2 full-time semesters to go) but keep seeing news about the upcoming patch that makes me want to return to hoard gold for the next expansion. I&#8217;m not sure how well my Alliance toons can hoard, not being Horde, but I do have one epic flying mount. 🙂</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly looking forward to the revamped original zones and some of the class changes have me pretty interested in getting a 30-day game card just for kicks. I&#8217;d just better not do it anywhere near finals.</p>

<p>My Mac has been downloading the update for about 2 weeks, now. One was 1.17GB and the other was 390MB. The patch notes from the PTR look like they transferred over, but I didn&#8217;t do a line by line comparison.</p>
<p>To my amazement, the patch installed and brought up the login screen with the new animation. I recorded it using Jing. It&#8217;s 180MB, but worth the wait until the end&#8230; you&#8217;ll see why!</p>

It&#8217;s slated on the login screen for a 12-hour maintenance window. We&#8217;ll see how long they really stay offline, but it will be well worth it. I remember the fun we had when they released 2.0 before BC came out, and this has even bigger gameplay changes: haircuts, no melee spell interrupts after two hits, and ratings affecting spells and melee.</p>
<p>Here are the full PTR patch notes, to fill you in on what is most likely going to be in the game tomorrow evening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>World of Warcraft PTR Patch 3.0.2</p>
<p>The latest test realm patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html</p>
<p>The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>* All players will have their talent points reimbursed and will have access to new talents throughout their trees; this includes the 51-point talents. Several new spells and abilities have been added for all classes. Players will need to visit their class trainer to learn new spells.<br>
* The Kirin Tor have made their move and so has Dalaran. Please watch your step around the crater that has been left behind!<br>
* The Barber Shop has been implemented and you can now visit one of the Barber Shops in the major cities to change your appearance. Be sure to get your Shave and a Haircut!<br>
* The all new Achievement System has been implemented and the Achievement panel can be accessed via the interface. While many achievements are not retroactive, we have done our best to credit as many as possible. Gamemasters will not be able to grant achievements for past accomplishements.<br>
* Stormwind Harbor is now open for business.<br>
* New towers have been added outside Of Orgrimmar and in Tirisfal Glades. Crews are currently at work to establish a new Zeppelin route to Northrend for your travel pleasure. Please no /spit off of the towers.<br>
* A new entrance is now viewable in the Caverns of Time.<br>
* Hit Rating, Critical Strike Rating, and Haste Rating now modify both melee attacks and spells.<br>
* Spell casting and spell channeling pushback has been changed to the following:<br>
o When casting a spell:<br>
+ The first and second hit will add .5 secs each to the cast time.<br>
+ All hits after the second will have no effect.<br>
o When channeling a spell:<br>
+ The first and second hit reduces current duration by 25% of total duration each.<br>
+ All hits after the second will have no effect.<br>
o Spellpower:<br>
+ All items and effects which grant bonuses to spell damage and spell healing are being consolidated into a single stat, Spellpower. This stat will appear with the same values found on items which grant “increased spell damage and healing” such as on typical Mage and Warlock itemization.<br>
# For classes which do not heal, they should see no change in the character sheet other than new tooltip wording.<br>
+ Healing characters will see their bonus healing numbers on the character sheet decrease, however, all healing spells have been modified to receive more benefit from spellpower than they received from bonus healing, with a net effect of no change to the amount healed by their spells. Some talents have had to be rebalanced to accommodate this change, but the amount healed will remain roughly the same. In addition, some talents will provide only healing spell power.</p>

<p>After the great patch download of March 25th, 2008 that is known as Patch 2.4, Gitr immediately flew from Stormwind to the Isle of Quel&#8217;Danas, which was conveniently already a flight point. After flying right up to Ironforge, the game went to the zone/instance loading screen and I was suddenly flying over the North Sea toward and island.</p>
<p>The flight path takes you around the south and west side all the way up to the very northern tip where you are dropped off at the familiar (if you&#8217;ve played a Blood Elf) area around Silvermoon City. I recognized the ship as being from near the partying belfs, the area to the south look exactly like the starting zone, and the area was hopping with people. There were at least 300 toons running around the immediate area on Silvermoon realm, taking my normal 55fps down to a crawling 20fps.<br>
<a title="Isle of Quel'Danas" href="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/2008-03-26/new-zone.jpg" rel="lightbox[865]" target="_blank"><!-- Removed broken local image --></a><br>
The first thing I did was scream. Bloody murder! My UI was <strong>completely</strong> broken! Well, I did neglect to check the &#8216;load outdated addons&#8217; from the character screen, but that&#8217;s beside the point. My WoWaceupdater refuses to work since I installed XP Service Pack 3 RC2. I know that was dangerous, but it solved my BSoD issue. I logged out to work on my research paper and slowly whittled away at downloading about 100 Ace addons.</p>
<p>When I logged back in later, I had most of my UI working and was able to complete 2 dailies for 9g each in about 10 minutes. As of this morning, Silvermoon is 47% done with the goal before Phase 2 opens up. I was very confused for some time until I researched what the heck was going on. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why people were killing things everywhere if there weren&#8217;t any more questgivers around.</p>
<p>I had a chance to run Magister&#8217;s Terrace, but it came a bit too late in the evening to due the trip justice. I&#8217;m probably a little better geared as dps now, but with good healing, I should be able to main tank it and enjoy playing it my way: toe to toe.</p>
<p>Did you get a chance to enter the Isle or Magister&#8217;s Terrace? How did you like it?</p>

<p>I have been in the dark about Patch 2.4 for a while because I started to seclude myself from the WoW news while I was sick. I just didn&#8217;t care to follow anything.</p>
<p>Now that has all changed. I found the changes they are putting into the patch and I&#8217;m totally stoked about some of it. Here&#8217;s my list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magister&#8217;s Terrace &#8211; There&#8217;s going to be enough well-geared people in my guild to let me run along on such a nice 5-man instance. I can&#8217;t devote the time to Kara, and I&#8217;m not geared for anything above that, so this is my end-game action for now.</li>
<li>The end (finally!) to getting CC&#8217;d mobs broken with multiple mob actions, such as Cleave, Multi-Shot, Avenger&#8217;s Shield, and Swipe. This is going to be a major improvement in the terrible life of PUGgers who have to group with idiots who can&#8217;t play their class.</li>
<li>For me and my pallies, I will enjoy Turn Undead working on demons, too.</li>
<li>In groups with druids, everyone will benefit from 20% lower mana cost on Regrowth.</li>
<li>Characters will now retain talented spell ranks so when they retalent they do not have to relearn the spells from trainers. Woot!</li>
<li>From wowwiki.com, &#8220;A representative of the Keepers of Time has been spotted at the World&#8217;s End Tavern in Shattrath. Players in good standing with the faction will be granted ease of passage to the Caverns of Time.&#8221; &#8216;Bout time! I hate getting to Tanaris from Shattrath.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s to hoping it comes out Tuesday.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/2007-11-15/shattrath_bank.jpg" rel="lightbox[814]" title="Shattrath City Guild Vault" target="_blank"><!-- Removed broken local image --></a>With the arrival of Patch 2.3, one of the most exciting things to me, both as a Guild Leader and a helplessly addicted Auction Hall player, was the addition of the long-awaited guild banks. Man, oh man, I&#8217;ve been waiting for this feature. Nothing sucks more than losing a newly crafted Lionheart Helm (back in the day when that was the best) because you started playing an alt and forgot it in the mailbox for an entire 30 days after an expired auction. Guild banks will allow us to throw everything for sale into the bank, and as GL, I can buy my own stinking tab for a while to store more than my mule can handle without worrying about losing stuff in the mail.<br>
Before I logged off Tuesday night, I got on my GL toon and went to Shattrath City to investigate the process of getting a Guild Vault going. What took me  5-10 minutes should be a breeze for you now, so thank me later, ok?</p>
<ol>
<li>Prance, gallop, run, or fly into a major city and find the bank. Near the bank will be a Guild Vault, each with a unique look for the city. Orgrimmar&#8217;s, for example, is a pot of gold (Lucky Charms, anyone?).</li>
<p><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/2007-11-15/buy_tab.jpg" rel="lightbox[814]" title="Buy a Vault Tab" target="_blank"><!-- Removed broken local image --></a></p>
<li>Ensure you have 100g on yourself, because that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to take. Ouch, I know, but check out all the space! With each tab you buy, you get a whopping 98 slots. That&#8217;s nearly an entire personal bank per tab, so for the initial investment for a small guild, it&#8217;s definitely worth it. The next two tabs increase to 250g and 500g each.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;ve got your tab, go to Guild Control and set the permissions for the guild ranks. You can customize the ability to view, deposit, and withdraw for each rank indivudually, including withdraw limits so new initiates can&#8217;t ninja the guild&#8217;s vast stockpiles of valuable raid mats. This will take a little bit of time at the beginning, but your stuff is worth it, right?</li>
<li>
<a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/2007-11-15/filling_bank.jpg" rel="lightbox[814]" title="Fill the Vault" target="_blank"><!-- Removed broken local image --></a>Start filling up your slots to your heart&#8217;s content. It will take a little while to figure out a system for storage for the different items based on permissions and the little details like that, but again, the time spent now is worth it.</li>
<li>Log in to your alts and open the doors to the vault to your guild and start a bank party today. Drinks are served in the nearby inn, of course.</li>
</ol>
<p><strike><strong>NOTE:</strong> I noticed tonight that the vault does not stack items. I think this is to trick us into buying new tabs when we don&#8217;t need them, but I digress. To get things to stack, place them in your bags (carefully if you have a low withdrawal limit) where they stack, and then re-deposit them into the vault.</strike></p>
<p><a href="https://gitrknowswow.com/images/2007-11-15/tb_vault.jpg" rel="lightbox[814]" title="Thunder Bluff Guild Vault" target="_blank"><!-- Removed broken local image --></a><strong>NOTE:</strong> This just in from Druidr, my newly bear formed alt: the Guild Vault in Thunder Bluff is just outside the bank! Don&#8217;t go running all over the place looking for it in a tent. It&#8217;s right in front of your eyes, but it looks like a plain old totem. This makes Thunder Bluff quite possibly the best place in all of Azeroth to be a blacksmith/miner. You have the mailbox, AH, trainers, forge, anvil, AND Guild Vault all right in one area. Paladr is <em>very </em>happy now.</p>
